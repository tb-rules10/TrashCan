### Helping customers understand the value of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota.

When Yakult was first put on sale in 1935, there was no other product with the revolutionary idea of furthering preventive medicine through the consumption of live microorganisms. 

When Yakult, a fermented milk drink containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, was introduced in 1935, there was no other product on the market that had the revolutionary idea of advancing preventive medicine through the consumption of live microorganisms. Naturally, their activities had to begin with explaining the value and effectiveness of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota to customers and assisting them in understanding this new concept. This fundamental approach has remained unchanged for Yakult to this day. They strive every day to provide as many customers as possible with timely access to the ever-growing research results and evidence they have accumulated, as well as to the steadily advancing knowledge of life science, by furthering the knowledge of their Yakult Ladies and employees through our systematic education system, and promoting grassroots awareness-raising activities globally. In particular, in addition to the daily work done by Yakult Ladies and sales staff in-store, they focus on sending guest lecturers to schools, holding health-related lectures open to the public, and conducting plant tours, as well as sharing information with opinion leaders such as doctors, nurses, registered dietitians, pharmacists, and probiotics researchers.

### Having customers continue consuming Yakult products regularly.

Yakult sales include both home delivery and retail store sales as well as online sales in certain countries including Japan. In order to maximize points of customer contact, products are designed to encourage customers to continue regular consumption, as opposed to drinking a large amount at one time, and by adopting a bottle size of 65 ml to 100 ml, daily consumption never becomes tiresome or too much. 

Yakult strives to create an environment that allows customers to experience the value and effectiveness of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota, whoever, whenever, and wherever they want. In order to maximise points of customer contact, their sales include both home delivery and retail store sales, as well as online sales in certain countries, including Japan. The products are intended to encourage customers to continue regular consumption rather than drinking a large amount at once, and by using a bottle size of 65 ml to 100 ml, daily consumption is never tiresome or excessive. To reinforce their daily consumption even further, the products are sold at a price that anyone can afford, allowing as many people as possible to benefit from their continued consumption. Furthermore, the Yakult bottle has evolved into more than just a liquid container, with customers all over the world viewing it as a symbol of the Yakult brand, representing health and quality. It is even a registered three-dimensional trademark in the United States, many countries in Europe, and other countries and regions around the world, which is not granted to just any drink container. This is a significant advantage for them in terms of increasing brand awareness.
